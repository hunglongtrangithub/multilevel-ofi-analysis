# Cross-Impact Analysis of Order Flow Imbalance in Equity Markets

## Overview

This project investigates the cross-impact relationships of Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) within equity markets. Using data from ten major Nasdaq 100 stocks, we evaluate self-impact and cross-impact effects on price dynamics over short horizons. The analysis involves calculating multi-level OFIs, applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and employing regression models (linear and Lasso) to study contemporaneous and predictive impacts.

### Key Findings

- **Self-Impact Models:** Show modest predictive power in contemporaneous settings, with mean in-sample R\(^2\) values of 0.12.
- **Cross-Impact Models:** Displayed no significant predictive ability, with coefficients and out-of-sample R\(^2\) values near zero.
- **OFI Spread:** Variations across OFI levels highlight the importance of robust data preprocessing.
- **Predictive Models:** Lagged OFIs fail to provide meaningful predictions for future price changes.
